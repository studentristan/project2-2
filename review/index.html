    <h2>1<sup>st</sup> October, 2019</h2>
    <h2>Review by Tristan Werden</h2>
    <p>While perhaps best remembered as the movie in
      which Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt became star-crossed lovers,
      <cite>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</cite> deserves more
      attention than your typical A-list action movie.
      In particular, the film’s trenchant critique of
      suburbia, marriage, and the lies we tell each other
      every day make it a relevant, contemporary movie.</p>
    <p>As the film is now almost 10 years old, I will be
      revealing some mild spoilers in this review, but it
      should not be enough to disturb enjoyment of the movie.</p>

    <h3>A Slow Death In Suburbia</h3>
    <p>The very first scene of the movie with John (Pitt)
     and Jane (Jolie) Smith features them in the modern
     suburban torture chamber: therapy in the office of
     a marriage counsellor. While denying that they need
     any kind of help (“Just a maintenance checkup” John
     claims) it is obvious that they are deeply
     uncomfortable in each other’s presence, a rawness
     helped by the fact that this was the first scene
     shot in the film.<sup><a href=#footnote>*</a></sup></p>
     <p>As told in flashback, the couple originally met
       under dramatic and emotionally heightened
      circumstances in Panama, framing both their
      attraction and the cause of their self-destruction.
      Each is an assassin for a rival company, but
      instinctively uses their cover as a civilian
      contractor from the moment they meet, successfully
      fooling each other for the first six years of their relationship.
      It is this same deceit that threatens the end of their marriage.</p>
    <p>In this way the film is very similar to
      <cite><a href=http://imdb.com/title/tt0111503>True Lies</a></cite>,
      the action-comedy film directed 10 years earlier by James Cameron.
      However, in that film the deceit was almost entirely one-sided, the
      manipulation significantly more disturbing, and
      (being a Cameron-Schwarzenegger film) focused much more on spectacle.</p>
    <p>While seeing each other as equals, it quickly becomes apparent that
      John and Jane are very different people. Jane is reserved, precise,
      analytical, poised; her husband is rough-and-tumble, raw and
      improvisational. Every remaining bit of their energy is devoted to
      maintaining a successful cover: a fine house, the latest model cars.
      But it is only in danger and risk that they come alive: life in
      suburbia is boredom and ennui, and it’s clear that they can’t wait
      to escape the prison they have built for themselves each day.</p>

    <h3>Marching Orders</h3>
    <p>When their respective employers discover who they work for, John and
      Jane are set to kill each other. While these first attempts fail, the
      seething resentment of both wife and husband fuels a series of mounting
      revenge attacks. Their destruction comes almost gleeful – you can see
      them actually <em>enjoying</em> themselves when they are hunting  each
      other, in stark contrast to the the passive-aggressive competition of
      their marriage – and ultimately frees them from the web of lies they have spun.</p>
    <p><img src=gunfight-in-the-department-store.jpg class="gunfight">Having
      failed in eliminating their rival, the previously inimical companies
      contracting John and Jane temporarily put aside their differences to end
      the problem of the Smiths, driving them closer together in survival
      instinct. The last third of the movie is the fight of John and Jane
      against the joined forces of their companies, culminating in a final
      showdown reminiscent of the climax in
      <cite><a href=http://imdb.com/title/tt0064115/>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a></cite>.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>While it is not without its faults (in particular Vincent Vaughn’s
      misogynistic, eternally frustrated character has become all too familiar
      in too many movies), the film also has a significant share of charm.
      The chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is natural and unfeigned, and the
      film mixes great action sequences with a barded critique of modern
      suburban life, and it remains, on the whole, one of my favourite films.</p>

    <p>Rating: &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</p>

    <p id=separate-ending><sup>*</sup> Sadly, the rest of the film was not shot
      chronologically: I was feel that doing so imparts an extra emotional
      verisimilitude to an actor’s performance, as they can express the
      emotional arc of their character in the same sequence that the audience
      experiences it.</p>
